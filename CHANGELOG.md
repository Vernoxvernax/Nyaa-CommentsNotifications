* Complete rewrite of the entire program to support better error-handling as well as a fully functional cache and obviously better readability.
* New features:
  * notification support for edited and deleted comments added. (edited ones will only be found if the amount of comments changed)
  * more precise discord embeds
  * optional role tagging in a specific channel
  * support for multiple email and gotify modules
  * support for multiple email recipient addresses
* and all the other changes I forgot about

* Note: since I don't have any control of nyaa and all the factors that play a role, I have to, again, basically test this code throughout the coming weeks, so expect upcoming fixes
