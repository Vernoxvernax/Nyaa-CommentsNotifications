* Attempt to fix multiple threads spawning when the discord bot reconnects
* Discord: If comments are too long, the message will be split and sent in different parts
* Discord: Removed "A new comment!" message for less bloat
* Discord: New releases messages now feature the actual uploaders gravatar instead of nyaa's default one.
* Comments in general: Markdown image embeds are now being stripped to only the url. f.e. `![](http://images.com/i.jpg)` -> `http://images.com/i.jpg`
* Cleaned up code a little bit
