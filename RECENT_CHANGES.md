* Fixed database creation mess (sorry got confused with paths)
* Implemented simple cache logic for the discord bot; the same URLs won't be fetched more than once now
* A little more verbose printing in the discord loop
* Fixed bug where strings containing `'` and `&` couldn't be inserted into the database
